        This is one of those super simple recipes that hopefully you will love and make again and again. The balsamic vinegar mellows out a bit as it cooks, but I definitely recommend making this only if you do like the taste of balsamic vinegar since it is the primary flavor here. </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<div class="section">
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked pasta</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil divided</li>
    <li> 1 pound smoked sausage cut into rounds or smaller</li>
    <li>1/2 medium onion chopped</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic minced</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper chopped</li>
<li> 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar </li>
<li> Salt & pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<div class="section">
    <ol>
    <p><li>Boil a salted pot of water for your pasta. Cook it al dente according to package directions.</li></p>
    <p><li>Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add in the sausage pieces and cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally so all sides get a chance to start browning.</li></p>
    <p><li>Add in the onions. Continue cooking (stirring occasionally) until the onions have started to lightly brown and the sausage gets some nice color. You may need to turn the heat down once it gets going so nothing burns.</li></p>
    <p><li>Stir in the red peppers and garlic. Cook for a minute or so (I like the red pepper to still have some crunch). </li></p>
    <p><li>Remove everything from the pan and set it aside, then pour the balsamic vinegar into the pan. Cook until it's reduced by half (about 1 minute or so), and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.</li></p>
    <p><li>Add a splash (a couple tablespoons or so) of the pasta water to the skillet prior to draining the pasta. Add the drained pasta to the pan and toss. Season with extra salt & pepper as needed. Serve immediately.</li></p>
    </ol>
